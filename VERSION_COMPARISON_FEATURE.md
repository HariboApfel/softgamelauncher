# Version Comparison Feature

## üÜï New Feature: Real-time Version Comparison

The Game Launcher now includes a real-time version comparison system that automatically fetches and compares versions from source URLs.

## üìä New UI Layout

The game list now includes two version columns:

1. **Current Version** - Your locally installed version
2. **Fetched Version** - Version fetched from the source URL with status indicators

## üé® Status Indicators

The fetched version column shows different status indicators:

### **‚úì Green Status (Up to Date)**
- **Format**: `1.2.3 ‚úì`
- **Meaning**: Your current version matches the fetched version
- **Action**: No action needed

### **‚ö† NEW (Update Available)**
- **Format**: `1.2.4 ‚ö† NEW`
- **Meaning**: A newer version is available
- **Action**: Consider updating your game

### **‚ö† DIFF (Version Mismatch)**
- **Format**: `1.2.1 ‚ö† DIFF`
- **Meaning**: Different version found, but not necessarily newer
- **Action**: Check if this is the correct version

### **Other Statuses**
- **`Checking...`** - Currently fetching version information
- **`Error`** - Failed to fetch version (network/parsing error)
- **`Not found`** - No version information found on the page
- **`No source`** - No source URL configured for this game

## üîÑ Automatic Updates

### **Real-time Checking**
- Version checks happen automatically when the application starts
- Each game with a source URL is checked in the background
- Results are displayed as they become available

### **Manual Refresh**
- Use the refresh button (üîÑ) in the toolbar to check all games again
- Individual games are re-checked when the list is refreshed

## üéØ How It Works

### **1. Automatic Detection**
- **F95zone URLs**: Automatically detected and parsed using specialized logic
- **GitHub URLs**: Uses GitHub API for release information
- **Other URLs**: Uses generic web scraping with configurable selectors

### **2. Version Comparison**
- Compares fetched version with your current version
- Shows clear status indicators for easy identification
- Updates in real-time as checks complete

### **3. Background Processing**
- Version checks run in background threads
- UI remains responsive during checks
- Notifications show when checks complete

## üìã Example Display

```
Game Name          | Current Version | Fetched Version
-------------------|-----------------|------------------
Warlock and Boobs  | 0.514.0.3      | 0.514.0.3 ‚úì
MyPigPrincess      | 0.9.0          | 0.9.1 ‚ö† NEW
Another Game       | 1.0.0          | Error
No Source Game     | 1.2.3          | No source
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Version Selectors**
You can configure custom version selectors for better accuracy:

1. **Edit a game** to access version configuration
2. **Set Version Selector**: CSS selector (e.g., `.version`, `#version`)
3. **Set Version Pattern**: Regex pattern (e.g., `v(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)`)
4. **Set Current Version**: Your installed version for comparison

### **F95zone Integration**
F95zone URLs are automatically handled with specialized parsing:
- Detects version format: `0.514.0.3 with RTP`
- No manual configuration required
- Works with all F95zone game threads
